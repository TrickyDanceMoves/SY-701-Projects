  ---- **Background** ----
*Nicholas Bohanan / Niccolo*
Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Visual Communicator | Security+ (SY0-701) Candidate

I bridge the gap between intuitive design and robust technical infrastructure. My focus is on mastering the core pillars of enterprise security—from identity management in Active Directory to deep-packet analysis and risk mitigation.

  ---- **Key Security Focus Areas** ----
Security Operations: Incident response, SIEM log correlation, and network monitoring.

Infrastructure: Managing secure file systems (Amazon FSx) and Identity Access Management (Active Directory).

Risk Management: Calculating ALE/SLE and implementing GRC frameworks (NIST, ISO, PCI...).

Network Defense: Hardening protocols (SSH, TLS) and securing email gateways (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).

---- **Technical Stack** ----

Tools:      Nmap, Wireshark, Nessus, Metasploit, Splunk, Kali Linux
Platforms:  AWS (FSx, EC2), Windows Server, Active Directory, Figma
Languages:  Markdown, PowerShell (Basics), CSS/HTML

  ---- **Current Goals/Achieved goals** ----
Pending Certification: Currently prepping for the CompTIA Security+ SY0-701.
Achieved: 2-yr degree in Information Technology, Comptia A+, Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

Projects: Building an automated home lab to simulate and remediate common attack vectors. Documenting solutions and hardening. Deploying pre-configured VM states.

Design: Revamping my technical portfolio to showcase security case studies with high visual clarity.

  ---- **Featured Projects** ----
 Identity Access Management and Security Operations - 

SIEM Log Aggregation/Analysis - Centralize database logs and statistics to Splunk.

PC Virtualization, patching and deployment - Provision VM's with different packages/profiles to demonstrate separated ACL's, Policy enforcement, applications per role, GPOs.

Design Touch: Since you use Figma, you can export a custom header image (1280x640) with a cool security-themed background and your logo to put at the very top of the page.

Would you like me to help you write the "Impact Statement" for your first featured project (like the Active Directory/FSx lab) to include in this bio?
