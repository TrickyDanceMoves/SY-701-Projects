  ---- **Background** ----
  
*Nicholas Bohanan / Niccolo*
Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Visual Communicator | Security+ (SY0-701) Candidate

I bridge the gap between intuitive design and robust technical infrastructure. My focus is on mastering the core pillars of enterprise security—from identity management in Active Directory to deep-packet analysis and risk mitigation.

  ---- **Key Security Focus Areas** ----
  
Security Operations: Incident response, SIEM log correlation, and network monitoring.

Infrastructure: Managing secure file systems (Amazon FSx) and Identity Access Management (Active Directory).

Risk Management: Calculating ALE/SLE and implementing GRC frameworks (NIST, ISO, PCI...).

Network Defense: Hardening protocols (SSH, TLS) and securing email gateways (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).

---- **Technical Stack** ----

Tools:      Nmap, Wireshark, Nessus, Metasploit, Splunk, Kali Linux

Platforms:  AWS (FSx, EC2), Windows Server, Active Directory, Figma

Languages:  Markdown, PowerShell (Basics), CSS/HTML

  ---- **Current Goals/Achieved goals** ----
  
Pending Certification: Currently prepping for the CompTIA Security+ SY0-701.

Achieved: 2-yr degree in Information Technology, Comptia A+, Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

Projects: Building an automated home lab to simulate and remediate common attack vectors. Documenting solutions and hardening. Deploying pre-configured VM states.

Design: Revamping my technical portfolio to showcase security case studies with high visual clarity.

  ---- **Featured Projects** ----
  
 Identity Access Management and Security Operations - Implement Least Privilege and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Windows Server 2022 environment, successfully eliminating vulnerabilities created by default settings by hardening 15+ default Administrative group settings and enforcing strict GPO-based account lockout policies.

SIEM Log Aggregation/Analysis - Centralize database logs and statistics to Splunk.

PC Virtualization, patching and deployment - Provision VM's with different packages/profiles to demonstrate separated ACL's, Policy enforcement, applications per role, GPOs.
